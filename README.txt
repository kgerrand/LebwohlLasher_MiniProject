This project was set as part of my final year module, 'Special Core in Software Engineering and High Performance Computing'.
The aim of this project is to explore various methods of accelerating code, and apply them to a Python program simulating the 2D Lebwohl-Lasher liquid crystal model. The approaches explored are as follows:
    - NumPy vectorisation
    - Numba
    - Cython
    - mpi4py
    - CuPy
Each of these appraoches are explored in individual Python scripts.

The methods are assessed by their performance, but factors such as ease of coding and flexibility are also considered. Additionally, I explore how the different approaches perform when the size of the problem (lattice size) increases, and when the number of threads changed. My findings are outlined in an associated report.
